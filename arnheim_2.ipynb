        "This Colab explores a range of architectures for generating stroke specifications, guided by the CLIPDraw interface produced by Kevin Frans et al recently, and extending our earlier work on Arnheim 1 in [Generative Art Using Neural Visual Grammars and Dual Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00162).\n",
        "\n",
        "For completeness, an evolutionary version of the original Arnheim 1 code is included in a separate Colab. However, its scope is limited with only 1 GPU, but you can modify the generative procedure and genotype to implement your own much more general picture generators that do not need to be differentiable, so you might find it useful for some of your own purposes. Enjoy playing with this stuff, and do post your creations and share your modifications :)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Arnheim 1 architecture was a rather idiosyncratic variant of a seq-to-seq model, more like an L-system in many respects, in which the input sequence embeddings and parameters of an encoder and decoder set of LSTMs were evolved. Unlike standard seq-to-seq models (without attention) however, the outputs of the encoder LSTM were sent to the decoder LSTM directly (not just the final hidden state). Each layer of LSTMs thus re-wrote the sentence produced by the LSTM before, resulting in a hierarchical organization of strokes which leant structure to the drawing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Originally optimized by an evolutionary algorithm using 500 GPUs, the system was rather inefficient (as the Arnheim 1 Colab demonstrates).  In this Colab the Arnheim architecture has been moved into a differentiable form with minor modification and is being used to generate the stroke descriptions for CLIPDraw, released by Kevin Frans, L.B. Soros, Olaf Witkowski https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14843, see their [original CLIPDraw Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kvfrans/clipdraw/blob/main/clipdraw.ipynb).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thanks to Kevin from CrossLabs, who showed me how to add a simple MLP to the CLIPDraw Colab, I added the Arnheim 2 architecture and a bunch of other architectures I wanted to try out with CLIPDraw. CLIPDraw uses pydiffsvg to allow the gradients from CLIP to pass through the image itself into the stroke descriptions. The original CLIPDraw used direct descriptions of strokes rather than using a neural network to generate the strokes.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Colab contains a variety of different architectures that can be trained by gradients transmitted through the picture itself (using diffsvg). **The style of the painting is highly constrained by the algorithmic procedure for its generation.** Without a generative architecture the painting lacks order to some extent, for example, marks are independent, only given order by feedback from CLIP rather than by any generative priors. The amazing work on photorealistic image generation e.g. with DALL-E https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/ and other VQ-GAN and Diffusion approaches use generators pre-trained on images to constrain this process. However, here we are interested not in imposing photographic priors but in imposing mark making priors explicitly in the architecture of the generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second way that style can be encoded is in hand designed **computational aesthetic losses** which measure some property of the painting throughout its production, e.g. the diversity of line thicknesses or some aspect of composition, and reward or punish the generator accordingly. We also explore some of these losses here, but leave them as a template for you to add your own creative new losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third kind of style constraint is a **material (motor spec) constraint** determined by the the nature of the marks that are made, e.g. lines (used in our original paper and Arnheim 1) to Beziers (used here in Arnheim 2). We intentionally do not explore that rich domain here, because it could extend to all kinds of processes including collage constructed from a predefined set of primitive cutouts, 3D forms, cabbages, etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "A forth kind of style constraint is more commonly explored, and that is to exploit the knowledge inside CLIP by using a **prompt modifier** such as \"in the style of Van Gough\" etc... We do not explore this here very much as it has been extensively studied elsewhere. Related approaches were tried before which included representing artists and styles in a manifold and exploring intermediate points in that low dimensional space which captures \"the shape of art history\", although this often resulted in rather derivative looking images, rather than genuinely novel styles: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07729\n",
        "\n",
        "After running the Colab one time, read the notes at the end of this Colab to see how the various parts of the code can be changed to generate different images.\n",

        "Running multiple levels of LSTM can be rather slow. The original motivation for the CPPN (compositional pattern producing network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network) was to remove the need for recurrance in generating an image. In the original CPPN the x,y coordinates are given to a network and at each specified pixel position a single pixel colour is outputted.\n",
        "A while ago we published the DPPN (differentiable pattern producing network (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02580)) which was extended to HyperNets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106). We generalize this principle to optimizing a set of x,y coordinates input into a network and interpreting the outputs as a stroke to be drawn at that x,y position.\n",
        "This is equivalent to having a big residual connection directly from the x,y input encoding to the output, and allows gradients to have much greater control over the x,y position of marks than if gradients are needed to adjust all the parameters in the network to achieve a change in the \"where\" of the stroke rather than the \"what\" of a stroke.\n",
        "The videos and images below compare the result of allowing this residual connection and not doing so, and examine the kinds of variation in the image that are produced as the depth of the network is modified. With deeper networks more correlated changes in the image become possible, e.g a global translation of the whole image is more likely with deeper networks. If you choose \"DPPN\" you can generate these kinds of images yourself.\n",
